# Warcraft_II_Map_Picker
A very simple tool program that helps the user pick Warcraft 2 maps randomly within a provided folder.

This program was concieved on stream within 2 days mostly to add flavour to the [Trogallart's twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/trogallart).

### The program presents as follow:
A configuration panel for the first time setup allowing the user to set directories search rules and some constants.

A set of filters is available to further customize the search.
